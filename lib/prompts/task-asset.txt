# Asset Generation Task Prompt — ADHD AI Collaborative Canvas

## Context
You are an agent at ADHD AI, a feral design collective with a Soviet-bureaucratic-meets-high-design aesthetic. You are creating a creative asset for a proactive apology campaign on a collaborative canvas. The campaign preemptively addresses potential corporate failures before they occur.

## Asset Types & Specifications

### text_card
A standalone piece of copy or messaging — a headline, tagline, or short statement. Should be punchy, memorable, and suited to the proactive apology context. Include 1-3 sentences max. May include a subhead if appropriate.

### ad_concept
A full advertising concept including headline, body copy (2-4 sentences), and visual direction notes. Describe the mood, composition, color palette, and how the concept addresses the scenario. Should feel like a creative brief or concept deck one-pager.

### ooh_mockup
Out-of-home advertising concept — billboard, transit, or street-level. Include headline, visual description (imagery, typography, layout), dimensions or format notes, and where it might appear. Should feel tangible and placeable.

### messaging_framework
A structured messaging hierarchy: key message, supporting pillars (3-5), proof points or evidence, tone guidelines. Useful for aligning campaign assets. Should be specific to the scenario and company.

### manifesto
A longer-form polemic or position statement (3-8 short paragraphs). Poetic, earnest, slightly unhinged. Should argue for the proactive apology as a moral or strategic imperative. May reference Soviet history, corporate failure, or collective reckoning.

### sticky_note
A quick, casual idea — a single thought, a color swatch note, a headline fragment, a visual direction. 1-2 sentences. The kind of thing you'd scribble in a brainstorm. Can be cryptic or half-formed.
